# ARC-Eval Compound Judge Architecture Roadmap
## Elevating to State-of-the-Art Agent Evaluation

*Based on latest research from Haize Labs' Verdict, MetaAuto AI, and 2024-2025 LLM-as-a-Judge advances*

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: Single-judge architecture per domain (6.5/10 quality)
**Target State**: Compound multi-judge DAG architecture with consensus mechanisms (9/10+ quality)
**Timeline**: 4 phases over 12 weeks
**Strategic Impact**: Position ARC-Eval as the leading agent evaluation platform vs Haize Labs' Verdict

---

## Research Foundation

### Key Insights from Latest Research

**1. MetaAuto AI's Agent-as-a-Judge Framework (ICML 2025)**
- **Core Innovation**: AI agents systematically judge other AI agents, not just text/completions
- **Methodology**: Continuous step-by-step feedback during task execution, not just final evaluation
- **Performance**: 97.72% time savings and 97.64% cost reduction vs human experts
- **Key Difference**: Evaluates entire agent workflows and reasoning chains, generating reward signals for self-improvement
- **Architecture**: Black-box evaluation with granular evidence collection during agent execution

**2. Judge Reliability Crisis (2024)**
- Single LLM judges suffer from: position bias, length bias, style bias, miscalibrated confidence
- Solution: Compound architectures with verification, debate, and consensus layers

**3. Haize Labs' Verdict Library Innovation**
- DAG-based evaluation pipelines where each node = specialized decision
- Multi-judge synthesis through reasoning, verification, debate, aggregation
- Scalable oversight through atomic evaluation units

**4. Academic Breakthroughs**
- JudgeBench (Oct 2024): Strong models perform barely better than random on challenging cases
- LLMEval2: Largest evaluation benchmark showing alignment gaps with human judgment
- Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge: 6+ bias types identified with mitigation strategies

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Strengths
- ✅ Domain-specific judges (Security, Finance, ML)
- ✅ Structured JSON responses with reward signals
- ✅ Cost management and fallback models
- ✅ Robust JSON parsing with multiple extraction methods

### Critical Gaps vs State-of-the-Art
- ❌ **Single-judge bottleneck**: Monolithic evaluation per domain vs compound multi-judge systems
- ❌ **No verification layer**: No secondary validation of judgments vs verification + consensus layers
- ❌ **Bias vulnerability**: Length, position, style biases unaddressed vs 6+ bias detection methods
- ❌ **No external benchmarks**: Can't integrate MMLU, HumanEval, GSM8K vs universal benchmark adapters
- ❌ **Static architecture**: No debate or consensus mechanisms vs DAG-based pipeline composition
- ❌ **Limited scalability**: Can't compose complex evaluation workflows vs distributed judge pools
- ❌ **Missing agent workflow evaluation**: Only evaluates final outputs vs MetaAuto's continuous step-by-step feedback
- ❌ **No reward signal generation**: Missing training data for agent improvement vs continuous learning loops

## Enterprise Complexity Management Strategy

### **CRITICAL: Maintaining Enterprise Usability While Scaling to State-of-the-Art**

## Immediate Actionable Steps (Week 0: Foundation)

**Priority: High utility, immediate usability, layered implementation**

### Step 1: Add Benchmark Integration (Quick Win - Days 1-3)
**Goal**: Support MMLU, HumanEval, GSM8K, etc. for immediate value
**Implementation**:
```python
# agent_eval/core/benchmark_adapter.py (minimal viable version)
class QuickBenchmarkAdapter:
    """Quick integration for popular benchmarks - immediate utility."""
    
    def load_mmlu_subset(self, subject: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[EvaluationScenario]:
        # Direct HuggingFace integration for fast value
        pass
    
    def load_humeval_subset(self, limit: int = 10) -> List[EvaluationScenario]:
        # Code evaluation scenarios
        pass
```
**CLI Enhancement**:
```bash
arc-eval --benchmark mmlu --subset anatomy --limit 20 --agent-judge
arc-eval --benchmark humeval --limit 10 --domain ml --agent-judge
```

### Step 2: Implement Verification Layer (High Impact - Days 4-7)
**Goal**: Second judge validates primary judgments for improved reliability
**Implementation**:
```python
# Extend existing agent_eval/core/agent_judge.py
class VerificationJudge:
    """Lightweight verification layer for immediate compound judging."""
    
    def verify_judgment(self, primary_result: JudgmentResult, output: AgentOutput) -> VerificationResult:
        # Independent re-evaluation with simplified prompt
        # Focus on catching obvious errors/biases
        pass
```
**Integration**: Add `--verify` flag to existing CLI commands

### Step 3: Add Confidence Calibration (Technical Depth - Days 8-10)
**Goal**: Use logprobs for uncertainty estimation and better decision making
**Implementation**:
```python
# Enhance APIManager in agent_eval/core/agent_judge.py
class EnhancedAPIManager(APIManager):
    def call_with_logprobs(self, prompt: str) -> Tuple[str, Dict[str, float]]:
        # Extract logprobs for key tokens: "pass", "fail", "warning"
        # Calculate calibrated confidence scores
        pass
```
**Value**: Better confidence scores, uncertainty quantification

### Step 4: Create Judge Comparison Mode (Validation - Days 11-12)
**Goal**: A/B test different judge configurations for optimization
**Implementation**:
```python
# agent_eval/core/judge_comparison.py
class JudgeComparison:
    """A/B test different judge configurations."""
    
    def compare_judges(self, judge_configs: List[Dict], scenarios: List[EvaluationScenario]) -> ComparisonReport:
        # Run same scenarios through different judge setups
        # Measure agreement, confidence calibration, bias patterns
        pass
```
**CLI**: `arc-eval --compare-judges --config judge_configs.yaml`

### Step 5: Add Bias Detection Metrics (Quality Assurance - Days 13-14)
**Goal**: Track and report common bias patterns for transparency
**Implementation**:
```python
# agent_eval/core/bias_detection.py (lightweight version)
class BasicBiasDetection:
    """Track common bias patterns in judge decisions."""
    
    def detect_length_bias(self, judgments: List[JudgmentResult], outputs: List[str]) -> BiasMetrics:
        # Correlate judgment quality with response length
        pass
    
    def detect_position_bias(self, judgments: List[JudgmentResult]) -> BiasMetrics:
        # Check if first/last options favored
        pass
```
**Integration**: Automatic bias reporting in existing evaluation results

### Immediate Value Layering Strategy

**Week 0 (Days 1-14): Foundation Layer**
- Day 1-3: Benchmark integration (immediate user value)
- Day 4-7: Verification layer (quality improvement) 
- Day 8-10: Confidence calibration (technical depth)
- Day 11-12: Judge comparison (optimization capability)
- Day 13-14: Bias detection (transparency/trust)

**Backward Compatibility**: All improvements extend existing API
**CLI Enhancement**: New flags that don't break existing workflows
**Immediate Utility**: Each step provides standalone value

### Success Criteria for Week 0
- ✅ Users can evaluate agents against MMLU/HumanEval benchmarks
- ✅ Verification layer catches 20%+ of primary judge errors
- ✅ Confidence scores correlate with judgment accuracy (>0.7)
- ✅ Judge comparison mode identifies optimal configurations
- ✅ Bias detection flags problematic patterns automatically

## Phase 2: Bias Detection & Mitigation (Weeks 4-6)

### 2.1 Comprehensive Bias Detection

class BiasDetectionJudge:
    """Detect and mitigate 6+ types of LLM judge biases."""
    
    def detect_all_biases(self, judgment: JudgmentResult, context: EvaluationContext) -> BiasReport:
        return BiasReport(

        # Check preference for formal vs informal language
        # Detect bias toward specific writing patterns
        pass
```

### 2.2 Bias Mitigation Strategies
