# ARC-Eval Compound Judge Architecture Roadmap
## Elevating to State-of-the-Art Agent Evaluation

*Based on latest research from Haize Labs' Verdict, MetaAuto AI, and 2024-2025 LLM-as-a-Judge advances*

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: Single-judge architecture per domain (6.5/10 quality)
**Target State**: Compound multi-judge DAG architecture with consensus mechanisms (9/10+ quality)
**Timeline**: 4 phases over 12 weeks
**Strategic Impact**: Position ARC-Eval as the leading agent evaluation platform vs Haize Labs' Verdict

---

## Research Foundation

### Key Insights from Latest Research

**1. Judge Reliability Crisis (2024)**
- Single LLM judges suffer from: position bias, length bias, style bias, miscalibrated confidence
- Solution: Compound architectures with verification, debate, and consensus layers

**2. Haize Labs' Verdict Library Innovation**
- DAG-based evaluation pipelines where each node = specialized decision
- Multi-judge synthesis through reasoning, verification, debate, aggregation
- Scalable oversight through atomic evaluation units

**3. Academic Breakthroughs**
- JudgeBench (Oct 2024): Strong models perform barely better than random on challenging cases
- LLMEval2: Largest evaluation benchmark showing alignment gaps with human judgment
- Survey on LLM-as-a-Judge: 6+ bias types identified with mitigation strategies

---

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Strengths
- ✅ Domain-specific judges (Security, Finance, ML)
- ✅ Structured JSON responses with reward signals
- ✅ Cost management and fallback models
- ✅ Robust JSON parsing with multiple extraction methods

### Critical Gaps
- ❌ **Single-judge bottleneck**: Monolithic evaluation per domain
- ❌ **No verification layer**: No secondary validation of judgments
- ❌ **Bias vulnerability**: Length, position, style biases unaddressed
- ❌ **No external benchmarks**: Can't integrate MMLU, HumanEval, GSM8K
- ❌ **Static architecture**: No debate or consensus mechanisms
- ❌ **Limited scalability**: Can't compose complex evaluation workflows

## Phase 1: Multi-Judge Consensus Architecture (Weeks 1-3)

### 1.1 Core Infrastructure

```python
# agent_eval/core/compound_judge.py
class CompoundJudge:
    """Multi-judge system with consensus and debate mechanisms."""
    
    def __init__(self, domain: str):
        self.primary_judge = DomainJudge(domain)           # Main evaluation
        self.verification_judge = VerificationJudge(domain) # Secondary validation
        self.bias_detection_judge = BiasDetectionJudge()   # Bias monitoring
        self.consensus_engine = ConsensusEngine()          # Judgment synthesis
        
    def evaluate_with_consensus(self, output: AgentOutput, scenario: EvaluationScenario) -> CompoundJudgmentResult:
        # Multi-stage evaluation with verification
        pass
```

### 1.2 Verification Layer Implementation

```python
class VerificationJudge:
    """Secondary judge that validates primary judgments."""
    
    def verify_judgment(self, primary_result: JudgmentResult, output: AgentOutput, scenario: EvaluationScenario) -> VerificationResult:
        # Independent re-evaluation with focus on edge cases
        # Cross-check reasoning consistency
        # Validate confidence calibration
        pass
    
    def detect_reasoning_gaps(self, primary_reasoning: str, output: str) -> List[str]:
        # Identify logical inconsistencies
        # Flag unsupported conclusions
        pass
```

### 1.3 Consensus Engine

```python
class ConsensusEngine:
    """Synthesize multiple judge opinions into final judgment."""
    
    def synthesize_judgment(self, primary: JudgmentResult, verification: VerificationResult, bias_check: BiasReport) -> CompoundJudgmentResult:
        # Weighted consensus based on confidence scores
        # Flag disagreements for human review
        # Generate meta-reasoning about judgment quality
        pass
    
    def resolve_disagreement(self, judge_results: List[JudgmentResult]) -> JudgmentResult:
        # Debate mechanism between judges
        # Evidence-based resolution
        pass
```

### 1.4 Enhanced Result Types

```python
@dataclass
class CompoundJudgmentResult:
    """Enhanced result with multi-judge consensus."""
    primary_judgment: JudgmentResult
    verification_result: VerificationResult
    bias_report: BiasReport
    consensus_judgment: str  # "pass", "fail", "warning", "disputed"
    consensus_confidence: float
    judge_agreement_score: float
    meta_reasoning: str  # Why judges agreed/disagreed
    evidence_quality: float
    human_review_required: bool
```

    """Detect and mitigate 6+ types of LLM judge biases."""
    
    def detect_all_biases(self, judgment: JudgmentResult, context: EvaluationContext) -> BiasReport:
        return BiasReport(
            length_bias=self.detect_length_bias(judgment, context),
            position_bias=self.detect_position_bias(judgment, context),
            style_bias=self.detect_style_bias(judgment, context),
            concreteness_bias=self.detect_concreteness_bias(judgment, context),
            familiarity_bias=self.detect_familiarity_bias(judgment, context),
            confirmation_bias=self.detect_confirmation_bias(judgment, context)
        )
    
    def detect_length_bias(self, judgment: JudgmentResult, context: EvaluationContext) -> BiasScore:
        # Check if judgment quality correlates with response length
        # Compare against length-normalized baselines
        pass
    
    def detect_position_bias(self, judgment: JudgmentResult, context: EvaluationContext) -> BiasScore:
        # Test if order of options affects judgment
        # A/B test with shuffled presentations
        pass
    
    def detect_style_bias(self, judgment: JudgmentResult, context: EvaluationContext) -> BiasScore:
        # Check preference for formal vs informal language
        # Detect bias toward specific writing patterns
        pass
```

### 2.2 Bias Mitigation Strategies

```python
class BiasMitigationEngine:
    """Active bias mitigation during evaluation."""
    
    def apply_length_normalization(self, outputs: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Truncate/pad to standard lengths for comparison
        pass
    
    def randomize_presentation_order(self, options: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
        # Shuffle option order to detect position bias
        pass
    
    def style_neutralization(self, text: str) -> str:
