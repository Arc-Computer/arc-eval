# ðŸš€ **RELIABILITY TRANSFORMATION ROADMAP**
*Transforming ARC-Eval from Evaluation Platform to Reliability Solution*

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This roadmap transforms ARC-Eval's debug workflow from Grade D+/C- to Grade B+ by leveraging existing world-class reliability analysis infrastructure. The approach focuses on **integration over innovation** - connecting existing components rather than building new ones.

**Core Strategy:** Use existing `ComprehensiveReliabilityAnalysis` capabilities in debug workflow + add simple predictive methods = Reliability prediction + cost optimization foundation.

### **ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVE 1: Debug Workflow Integration**
Transform debug workflow to properly leverage existing `ReliabilityAnalyzer` capabilities

### **ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVE 2: Reliability Visibility** 
Provide users with clear, proactive reliability insights using existing analysis + simple predictions
