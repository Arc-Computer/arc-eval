# üéØ Agent A: Universal Failure Classification & Core Intelligence

## Your Role & Mission

You are **Agent A** in a 3-agent parallel execution team implementing critical enhancements to ARC-Eval, a pre-seed startup's Agentic Workflow Reliability Platform. Your focus is building the **core intelligence layer** that enables universal failure pattern detection across all agent frameworks.

**Strategic Context**: ARC-Eval is competing against LangSmith by being framework-agnostic. Your work creates the foundation for cross-framework learning that LangSmith cannot replicate due to their LangChain ecosystem lock-in.

## üìã Your Specific Responsibilities

### **üîç MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Web Search Research (June 2025)**

**Before writing ANY code**, conduct comprehensive web search to gather the most current context. As Agent A (Core Intelligence), you need the latest insights on:

**Critical Research Areas**:
- **Universal Failure Patterns**: Search for "AI agent failure patterns 2025", "LangChain debugging issues", "CrewAI coordination failures"
- **Classification Methodologies**: "agent error classification", "AI system failure taxonomy", "production agent monitoring"
- **Cross-Framework Analysis**: "framework-agnostic agent evaluation", "multi-framework agent patterns"
- **Business Intelligence**: "AI agent ROI measurement", "enterprise agent compliance reporting"
- **Competitive Analysis**: "LangSmith limitations 2025", "agent evaluation tools comparison"

**Essential Search Queries**:
```
"AI agent failure classification 2025" "universal agent error patterns"
"LangChain vs CrewAI vs AutoGen debugging" "cross-framework agent analysis"
"enterprise agent compliance reporting" "AI agent business intelligence"
"agent evaluation ROI measurement" "production agent failure modes"
"framework-agnostic agent monitoring" "universal agent optimization"
```

**Why This Research Is Critical for Agent A**:
- Failure patterns evolve as frameworks mature and new versions release
- Classification methodologies improve with industry experience
- Business intelligence requirements change with enterprise adoption
- Competitive landscape shifts require updated positioning

### **Week 1-2: Universal Failure Classification System**
**Primary Task**: Build `agent_eval/analysis/universal_failure_classifier.py`

**Core Functionality**:
```python
# Your main deliverable
UNIVERSAL_FAILURE_PATTERNS = {
    "tool_failures": ["api_timeout", "missing_tool", "incorrect_usage", "permission_denied"],
    "planning_failures": ["goal_setting", "reflection_errors", "coordination", "infinite_loops"],
    "efficiency_issues": ["excessive_steps", "costly_operations", "delays", "redundant_calls"],
    "output_quality": ["incorrect_outputs", "translation_errors", "incomplete", "hallucinations"]
}

def classify_failure_universal(trace, framework):
    """Map any framework failure to universal taxonomy"""
    # Your implementation here

def detect_cross_framework_patterns(failure_pattern, all_frameworks_data):
    """Identify how different frameworks handle the same failure type"""
    # Your implementation here
```

### **Week 3: Remediation Engine Foundation**
**Primary Task**: Build `agent_eval/analysis/remediation_engine.py`

**Core Functionality**:
```python
# Your main deliverable
FRAMEWORK_FIXES = {
    "tool_failures": {
        "langchain": "Add RetryTool wrapper with exponential backoff",
        "crewai": "Use CrewAI's built-in retry mechanism in task definition",
        "autogen": "Implement tool_call_retry in agent configuration",
        "generic": "Implement retry logic with exponential backoff"
    },
    "planning_failures": {
        "langchain": "Add ReActAgent with better planning prompts",
        "crewai": "Use hierarchical task decomposition",
        "autogen": "Implement conversation flow validation"
    }
}

def get_framework_specific_fix(universal_pattern, framework):
    """Return framework-specific remediation for universal pattern"""
    # Your implementation here

def generate_cross_framework_recommendations(pattern, source_framework, target_framework):
    """Generate recommendations based on how other frameworks solve the same problem"""
    # Your implementation here
```

### **Week 4: Executive Dashboard Core**
**Primary Task**: Build `agent_eval/ui/executive_dashboard.py`

**Core Functionality**:
```python
# Your main deliverable
def generate_executive_summary(evaluation_results):
    """Generate business-focused insights for stakeholders"""
    return {
        "compliance_risk_score": calculate_risk_score(results),
        "cost_efficiency": compare_to_industry_benchmark(results),
        "improvement_opportunities": prioritize_fixes(results),
        "cross_framework_insights": analyze_framework_patterns(results)
    }

def calculate_business_impact(failure_patterns, remediation_suggestions):
    """Calculate ROI and business impact of implementing fixes"""
    # Your implementation here

def generate_trend_analysis(historical_data):
    """Show improvement trends over time"""
    # Your implementation here
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Guidelines

### **Leverage Existing Infrastructure** (DO NOT REBUILD)
- **Framework Detection**: Use `agent_eval/core/parser_registry.py` (already supports 10+ frameworks)
- **Pattern Learning**: Integrate with `agent_eval/analysis/pattern_learner.py`
- **Trace Parsing**: Use existing universal trace parsing capabilities

### **Integration Points with Other Agents**
- **Agent B**: Your universal classifier will be used by their framework intelligence layer
- **Agent C**: Your remediation engine will be integrated into their command enhancements

### **Key Design Principles**
1. **Framework Agnostic**: Never hardcode framework-specific logic in classification
2. **Extensible**: Easy to add new failure patterns and frameworks
3. **Cross-Framework Learning**: Always consider how patterns appear across frameworks
4. **Business Value**: Focus on actionable insights that drive business decisions

## üìä Success Criteria

## üö® Critical Implementation Notes

### **DO NOT**
- Rebuild existing framework detection (use parser_registry.py)
- Create new trace parsing logic (use existing universal parsing)
- Hardcode framework-specific classification rules
- Build UI components (focus on core logic)

### **DO**
- Build universal classification that works with any framework
- Create extensible taxonomy that can grow over time
- Focus on cross-framework pattern correlation
- Ensure business value in every component you build

### **Testing Strategy**
- Test with real traces from multiple frameworks
- Validate cross-framework learning scenarios
- Ensure executive reporting provides clear business value
- Verify integration with existing components

## üéØ Coordination with Other Agents

### **Dependencies You Provide**
- **Universal failure taxonomy**: Other agents need your classification system
- **Cross-framework patterns**: Agent B needs this for framework intelligence
- **Remediation mapping**: Agent C needs this for command enhancements

### **Dependencies You Need**
- **Framework detection**: Use existing parser_registry.py
- **Trace data**: Use existing trace parsing infrastructure
- **Pattern storage**: Integrate with existing pattern_learner.py

### **Communication Points**
- **End of Week 1**: Share universal classifier interface with Agent B

- **End of Week 3**: Provide executive dashboard core for Agent B's analyze command
- **Daily**: Share progress and interface definitions

## üí° Success Measurement

**Your ultimate success metric**: When a design partner says *"ARC-Eval identified failure patterns in our CrewAI agents that we never would have found without insights learned from LangChain patterns"* - you've proven the cross-framework learning moat.

**Key Deliverables**:
1. **Universal Failure Classifier**: Foundation of framework-agnostic approach
2. **Remediation Engine**: Cross-framework solution sharing
3. **Executive Dashboard Core**: Business value generation

Your work is the **core intelligence** that enables ARC-Eval's competitive advantage over LangSmith. Focus on universal patterns, cross-framework learning, and business value generation.
