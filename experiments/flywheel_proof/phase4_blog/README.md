# Phase 4: Technical Blog & Documentation

**Timeline**: Week 4 (June 23 - June 30)  
**Objective**: Create technical blog post and reproducible code package

## Key Tasks

### 4.1 Technical Blog Creation
- [ ] Write comprehensive blog post with real experimental data
- [ ] Integrate academic research citations from 2024 papers
- [ ] Include performance charts and metrics
- [ ] Document complete methodology and findings

### 4.2 Reproducible Code Package
- [ ] Organize all experimental code for external validation
- [ ] Create setup and execution scripts
- [ ] Document dependencies and requirements
- [ ] Provide verification procedures

### 4.3 External Validation
- [ ] Package complete experiment for reproduction
- [ ] Create validation scripts and expected outcomes
- [ ] Document troubleshooting and common issues
- [ ] Prepare for community feedback

## Blog Post Structure

### Introduction
