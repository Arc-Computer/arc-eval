## Academic Foundation

Based on 2024-2025 research validating **Automated Curriculum Learning (ACL) > Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT)** for compliance:

### Key Research Supporting Our Approach

**"LBS-3: Let's Be Self-Generated via Step-by-Step"** (arXiv:2410.21728)
- ACL boosts reasoning accuracy 4-8 points vs RLHF baselines on GSM-8K/StrategyQA
- Uses ~35% less compute than traditional RFT approaches
- **Key insight**: Easy-to-hard synthesis guided by model itself closes performance gaps without expensive reward models

**"IT2ACL: Learning Easy-to-Hard Instructions via 2-Phase Automated Curriculum"** (ACL 2024)
- Outperforms fixed-order fine-tuning across 70 datasets
- Shows larger gains on hardest tasks using bandit scheduler
- **Key insight**: Dynamic difficulty targeting matters more than absolute data volume

**"CurricuLLM: Environment-Curriculum via LLMs"** (arXiv:2409.18382)
- Accelerates robot-skill RL by 2-3× in simulation-to-real transfer
- **Key insight**: Curriculum generation scales to sequential-decision agents, not just static QA

### Why ACL Beats RFT for ARC-Eval Use Case

| **Dimension** | **Automated Curriculum (Our Approach)** | **Reinforcement Fine-Tuning** |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Data Creation** | Uses ground-truth pass/fail traces → automatically labeled | Needs dense reward; compliance often collapses to binary "0/1" |
| **Sample Efficiency** | Targets only weak spots; 25-40% fewer tokens for equal gains | Exploration phase can overwhelm gains |
| **Stability/Governance** | Pure supervised updates → deterministic rollbacks, audit-friendly | Policy gradients add variance; harder for SOX/EU-AI-Act audits |
| **Engineering Lift** | Re-uses existing SFT infrastructure | Must stand up reward model, off-policy storage, experimentation infra |

**Research Consensus**: *"For rule-heavy, high-precision tasks, ACL is often the faster, cheaper, and more auditable first line of improvement"*

## Key Deliverables

### Core Experimental Outputs
1. **Failure-Trace Stratification System**: Bucket scenarios by error type × model confidence using existing examples
2. **Bandit-Style Curriculum Scheduler**: Dynamic difficulty targeting based on learning progress metrics  
3. **ACL Performance Data**: Charts showing rapid improvement vs traditional approaches
4. **Enterprise Audit Trail**: Deterministic, governance-friendly improvement documentation

### Research Validation Package
5. **Technical Blog**: ACL vs RFT comparison with real experimental data and 2024-2025 citations
6. **Academic Integration**: Implementation of IT2ACL bandit scheduling and LBS-3 self-generation principles
7. **Sample Efficiency Analysis**: 25-40% token reduction demonstration per research findings
8. **Reproducible Code Package**: Complete experiment for external validation and enterprise adoption

### Practical Implementation Pattern (Per Latest Research)
```
1. Failure-trace stratification → Bucket by scenario ID × error type × confidence
2. Bandit-style scheduler → Focus on buckets showing learning progress  
3. SFT/DPO loop → Fine-tune with Direct Preference Optimization on labeled pairs
4. Periodic validation → Measure against 378 scenarios for comprehensive coverage
```

**Research Foundation**: *"ACL is no longer a poor cousin of RL—for rule-heavy, high-precision tasks it is often the faster, cheaper, and more auditable first line of improvement, with RFT reserved for fuzzy edges."*
