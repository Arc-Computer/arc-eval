# Phase 2: Enhanced Improvement Loop

**Timeline**: Week 2 (June 7 - June 14)  
**Objective**: Execute 30 improvement iterations using research-validated methodology

## Research Foundation

Implements 2024 automated curriculum learning research:
- **Skill-based Bayesian Networks** for improvement targeting
- **Scenario-based Curriculum Generation** for adaptive learning
- **Reward-driven Automated Curriculum** for progress optimization

## Three-Level Improvement Strategy

### Level 1: Scenario-Driven Fixes (Iterations 1-10)
- Direct compliance violations detected by domain scenarios
- Immediate fixes for PII exposure, AML violations, bias issues
- Fast iteration cycle targeting critical failures

### Level 2: Adaptive Curriculum Learning (Iterations 11-20)  
- Progressive difficulty based on agent capability assessment
- Enhanced reasoning patterns and tool usage optimization
- Behavioral improvements guided by evaluation feedback

### Level 3: Skill-Based Targeting (Iterations 21-30)
- Bayesian network-guided improvement prioritization
- Domain-specific optimization using existing `self_improvement.py`
- Fine-tuned curriculum based on weakness analysis

## Key Tasks

### 2.1 Enhanced Improvement System
- [ ] Implement skill-based targeting using existing infrastructure
- [ ] Create scenario-driven fix application system
- [ ] Build adaptive curriculum selection mechanism

### 2.2 Execute 30 Iterations
- [ ] Run complete improvement cycle automatically
- [ ] Track performance metrics across all iterations
- [ ] Monitor pass rate progression 42% → 91%

### 2.3 Performance Tracking
- [ ] Log detailed metrics for each iteration
- [ ] Track improvement velocity and trends
- [ ] Monitor compliance framework coverage

## Scripts to Create
- `enhanced_improvement_loop.py` - Main improvement execution
- `skill_based_targeting.py` - Bayesian-style improvement prioritization
- `adaptive_curriculum.py` - Progressive difficulty management
- `iteration_tracker.py` - Performance metrics collection

## Expected Outputs
- ✅ 30 completed improvement iterations
- ✅ 91%+ final compliance achievement
- ✅ Performance data showing progression
- ✅ Time savings documentation (minutes vs weeks)

## Academic Validation
- Curriculum learning promotes effective policy development
- Scenario-based training shows improved transfer capabilities
- Skill-based targeting outperforms random improvement approaches
