# AgentEval Domain Deepening Plan: Enterprise-Grade Evaluation Framework

## Executive Summary

This plan transforms AgentEval from 45 basic scenarios to 350+ enterprise-grade evaluation scenarios across Security, Finance, and ML Infrastructure domains. Incorporating insights from Vals.ai's methodology and Allen AI's DataDecide research, we will build evaluation depth matching Purple Llama CyberSecEval standards while maintaining competitive advantages through synthetic data and domain specialization.

## Strategic Context

### Market Validation
Our pilot partners (Palo Alto Networks, Protocol Labs, Snowflake, NVIDIA) are sophisticated enterprise customers who will immediately recognize shallow evaluations. Building depth now enables:
- **Explosive viral growth** potential in enterprise compliance teams
- **CISO-stakeable results** for boardroom presentations
- **Competitive moat** through proven evaluation rigor

### Research-Backed Approach
Integrating cutting-edge evaluation methodologies:
- **Vals.ai Framework**: LLM-as-Judge, multi-step agent evaluation, private test sets
- **DataDecide Insights**: Multi-metric evaluation, scaling predictions, computational efficiency
- **Purple Llama Standard**: 8-category benchmark structure, MITRE ATT&CK mapping
