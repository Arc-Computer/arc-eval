# 01. Arc-Eval Strategy Overview

## Market Problem

80-90% of AI proof-of-concepts fail to reach production. Enterprises discover critical failures only after deployment when customers complain. Current evaluation tools are reactive—they alert you after problems occur rather than preventing them.

## Our Solution: Bring Your Own Agent (BYOA)

Arc-Eval tests and improves AI agents from any framework. We catch failures before they reach production.

### How BYOA Works

1. **Upload any agent** - Automatic framework detection (LangChain, OpenAI, CrewAI, custom)
2. **Get reliability report** - Reliability grade (A-F), cost analysis, compliance gaps
3. **Receive optimizations** - Specific code fixes, model recommendations, retry logic
4. **Deploy with confidence** - Predictive reliability, compliance validation, cost optimization

## Data Strategy

Every agent profiled makes Arc-Eval smarter for all users through cross-framework learning.

### Network Effect Flywheel

```
More Agents Profiled → More Diverse Patterns → Better All Agents
        ↑                                              ↓
Better Customer Outcomes ← Stronger Recommendations ← Richer Dataset
```

### Learning From Different Agent Types

- PHI leak in LangChain agent → Prevent similar leaks in all OpenAI Assistants
- Cost optimization in custom framework → Apply model selection insights universally
- Voice agent accuracy fix → Improve reasoning patterns for all agents

### Data Collection Focus

- Agent architecture patterns across frameworks
- Performance characteristics by use case
- Failure mode analysis and remediation strategies
- Optimization outcomes and ROI metrics

## Current Technical Foundation

### Production-Ready Components

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Core Evaluation Engine | ✓ Production | 15,000+ lines, 378 scenarios |
| Framework Detection | ✓ Production | 9+ frameworks auto-detected |
| Agent-as-a-Judge | ✓ Production | 92% accuracy vs 70% alternatives |
| Compliance Reporting | ✓ Production | SOX, GDPR, HIPAA support |
| Fix Generation | ✓ Production | Framework-specific recommendations |
| Cost Tracking | ✓ Production | Per-run cost analysis |

### Missing Components

| Component | Impact | Build Effort |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Runtime Monitoring | Can't see agents as they run | 750 lines |
| Production Learning | Manual failure analysis | 1,000 lines |
| Custom Domains | Limited to 3 verticals | 1,000 lines |

## Strategic Positioning

Arc-Eval starts as agent testing but becomes embedded in team workflows, making it hard to replace.

### Embedding Strategy

1. **Pre-deployment validation** becomes mandatory in CI/CD
2. **Continuous monitoring** integrated in production systems
3. **Audit trails** required for compliance reporting
4. **Team workflows** built around Arc-Eval insights
5. **Organizational knowledge** stored in Arc-Eval

### Core Belief

Enterprises don't want multiple vendors for agent reliability. They want one platform that works with any agent regardless of framework, model, or architecture.
