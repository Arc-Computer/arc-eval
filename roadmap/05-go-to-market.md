## Core Messaging

### What We Tell Customers
"Prevent 80-90% of agent failures before they reach production"

### Three Pillars

1. **Find Problems Early**
   - 92% accuracy with Agent-as-a-Judge
   - Prevent failures vs. detect them
   - Learn from production continuously

2. **Works With Any Tool**
   - Works with any agent architecture
   - No vendor lock-in
   - Cross-framework optimization

3. **Built for Big Companies**
   - Local-first deployment option
   - Compliance reporting built-in
   - Team collaboration features

### Positioning Statement
"Arc-Eval is the only platform that prevents agent failures before production through predictive evaluation that works with any framework."

## Competitive Strategy

### Against Monitoring Tools (Arize, Freeplay)

| Their Weakness | Our Strength | Talk Track |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Reactive monitoring | Predictive prevention | "Why wait for failures when you can prevent them?" |
| Cloud-only | Local-first option | "Keep your data where you need it" |
| Generic metrics | Agent-specific evaluation | "Built specifically for AI agents, not adapted from APM" |

### Against Developer Tools (LangSmith, Confident AI)

| Their Weakness | Our Strength | Talk Track |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Single framework | Framework agnostic | "Works with all your agents, not just one vendor" |
| Developer-focused | Enterprise-ready | "From POC to production with compliance built-in" |
| Evaluation only | Full optimization | "Not just scores, but specific fixes" |

### Against Hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, Google)

| Their Weakness | Our Strength | Talk Track |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Generic solutions | Agent-specific | "Purpose-built for agent reliability" |
| Vendor lock-in | Independent platform | "Choose the best models without platform constraints" |
| Slow innovation | Rapid iteration | "Weekly improvements vs. quarterly updates" |
