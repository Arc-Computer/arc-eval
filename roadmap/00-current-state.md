# Arc-Eval: Complete Solution Overview

## What Arc-Eval Does

Arc-Eval helps developers build reliable AI agents by testing them before production, monitoring them while they run, and automatically fixing problems when they occur.

## Customer Problems We Solve

| **Problem** | **What Customers Tell Us** | **How Arc-Eval Solves It** |
|---|---|---|
| **Problem 1** | "Will this agent complete tasks correctly?" | Shows success rate with letter grades (A-F) and tracks performance over time |
| **Problem 2** | "How much are agents costing us?" | Tracks cost per agent run and suggests ways to reduce API bills |
| **Problem 3** | "What edge cases will break in production?" | Automatically creates tests from real failures so they never happen again |
| **Problem 4** | "Need to evaluate any agent framework" | Works with LangChain, CrewAI, OpenAI, and 6+ other frameworks with one line of code |
| **Problem 5** | "Show me how to fix problems" | Provides exact code to fix issues, not just error reports |
| **Problem 6** | "Prove agent quality to customers" | Generates professional PDF reports showing compliance and reliability |
| **Problem 7** | "Detect data leaks at runtime" | Monitors agents in real-time for privacy violations |
| **Problem 8** | "Meet compliance requirements" | Tests against SOX, GDPR, HIPAA and other regulations |

## The Three Parts of Arc-Eval

### 1. Test Before Production
- **Built-in Tests**: 378 pre-made tests for finance, security, and ML applications
- **Custom Tests**: Create tests for your specific needs (healthcare, logistics, retail, etc.)
- **Smart Generation**: AI creates comprehensive test suites in 2 minutes

### 2. Monitor During Production  
- **Real-time Tracking**: See what your agents are doing as they run
- **Performance Grades**: Get A-F reliability scores like a report card
- **Cost Analysis**: Know exactly how much each agent run costs

### 3. Fix and Improve Automatically
- **Learn from Failures**: When something breaks, Arc-Eval creates a test so it won't break again
- **Code Fixes**: Get the exact code to fix problems, copy and paste ready
- **Gets Smarter**: The more you use it, the better it gets at finding and fixing issues

## How It All Works Together

### Week 1: Set Up Testing
```bash
# Create tests for your specific use case
arc-eval scenario create --domain healthcare --scenarios 100

# Run compliance tests
arc-eval compliance --domain custom:healthcare --input agent_outputs.json
```

### Week 2: Add Monitoring
```python
# Add one line to your agent code
from agent_eval.trace import ArcTracer
tracer = ArcTracer("healthcare")
agent = tracer.trace_agent(your_agent)

# Now you get real-time monitoring
arc-eval debug --live
```

### Week 3: Continuous Improvement
```bash
# When a failure happens in production:
arc-eval scenario create --from-last-failure
# Creates: "Test for patient data exposure issue"

# Get the fix:
arc-eval improve --live
# Shows: "Add this validation code to prevent the issue"
```

## What Makes Arc-Eval Different

| **Feature** | **Other Tools** | **Arc-Eval** |
|---|---|---|
| **Creating Tests** | You write each test manually | AI generates comprehensive test suites |
| **Finding Problems** | Shows you what went wrong | Shows what went wrong AND how to fix it |
| **Domain Coverage** | Generic testing | Specific tests for finance, security, ML, and custom domains |
| **Cost Management** | Shows current costs | Shows costs AND suggests optimizations |
| **Learning** | Static - same tests forever | Dynamic - learns from your actual failures |

## Real Results

When you use Arc-Eval, you can expect:
- **Reliability**: Increase from 73% to 89% success rate
- **Cost**: Reduce API costs by 62% through smart optimizations  
- **Compliance**: Pass 100% of regulatory requirements
- **Speed**: Find and fix issues 5x faster than manual debugging

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Runtime monitoring (track reliability and costs)
- **Week 3-4**: Custom scenario generation (test any domain)
- **Month 2**: Full integration with your development workflow

## Simple Integration

### For Any Python Agent:
```python
# Before Arc-Eval
response = agent.run(user_input)

# After Arc-Eval (1 line added)
from agent_eval.trace import ArcTracer
agent = ArcTracer("finance").trace_agent(agent)
response = agent.run(user_input)  # Now monitored!
```

### For Any Framework:
- LangChain ✓
- CrewAI ✓
- AutoGen ✓
- OpenAI SDK ✓
- Anthropic SDK ✓
- Custom agents ✓

## Getting Started

1. **Install**: `pip install arc-eval`
2. **Quick Test**: `arc-eval compliance --domain finance --quick-start`
3. **Add Monitoring**: Insert one line of code in your agent
4. **View Results**: `arc-eval debug --live`

## Summary

Arc-Eval is the only platform that:
1. **Tests** your AI agents before they go live
2. **Monitors** them while they're running
3. **Fixes** problems automatically when they occur

It's built for developers who need their AI agents to be reliable, compliant, and cost-effective in production.
