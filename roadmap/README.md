## Reading Guide

### For Technical Team
1. Start with [01-strategy-overview.md](01-strategy-overview.md) for context
2. Review [07-technical-foundation.md](07-technical-foundation.md) for architecture
3. Deep dive into [02-phase1-runtime-tracing.md](02-phase1-runtime-tracing.md)
4. Review [03-phase2-web-interface.md](03-phase2-web-interface.md) and [04-phase3-custom-scenarios.md](04-phase3-custom-scenarios.md)
5. Reference [06-quick-reference.md](06-quick-reference.md) for daily use

### For GTM Team
1. Start with [01-strategy-overview.md](01-strategy-overview.md) for product vision
2. Focus on [05-go-to-market.md](05-go-to-market.md) for execution
3. Use [arc-eval-solution-overview.md](arc-eval-solution-overview.md) for customer conversations
4. Reference [06-quick-reference.md](06-quick-reference.md) for metrics and objection handling

### For Leadership
1. Read [01-strategy-overview.md](01-strategy-overview.md) for strategic direction

3. Check [06-quick-reference.md](06-quick-reference.md) for key metrics

## Key Decisions

- **Architecture**: Local-first, framework-agnostic, plugin-based
- **Market**: Enterprise VPs of Engineering with $100K+ budgets
- **Differentiation**: Predictive vs. reactive, BYOA strategy
- **Priorities**: Runtime monitoring → Web interface → Custom domains

## Next Steps

1. Ship runtime monitoring (ArcTracer) for immediate value
2. Build web dashboard for team adoption
3. Enable custom domain generation for market expansion
4. Execute enterprise GTM strategy
