# Arc-Eval Product Roadmap

This folder contains the complete product strategy for Arc-Eval's evolution from a CLI testing tool to the industry standard for AI reliability.

## üìö Document Guide

### Start Here
1. **[00-executive-summary.md](00-executive-summary.md)** - One-page vision and strategy
2. **[arc-eval-solution-overview.md](arc-eval-solution-overview.md)** - Customer-facing explanation

### The Journey
1. **[01-current-state.md](01-current-state.md)** - Where we are today (strong foundation)
2. **[02-phase1-runtime-tracing.md](02-phase1-runtime-tracing.md)** - Weeks 1-2: Add monitoring  
3. **[03-phase2-web-interface.md](03-phase2-web-interface.md)** - Weeks 3-4: Visual dashboard
4. **[04-phase3-custom-scenarios.md](04-phase3-custom-scenarios.md)** - Month 2: Any domain
5. **[05-end-state-vision.md](05-end-state-vision.md)** - Where this leads (platform vision)

### Implementation Details
- **[custom-scenario-generation.md](custom-scenario-generation.md)** - Technical deep-dive on scenario generation
- **[archive/roadmap-technical-details.md](archive/roadmap-technical-details.md)** - Original technical roadmap (1093 lines)

## üéØ The Core Strategy

**We solve one burning problem exceptionally well:**
> "Will my AI agent work correctly in production?"

We answer this with three capabilities:
1. **Test** before deployment (current)
2. **Monitor** during runtime (weeks 1-2)
3. **Improve** continuously (weeks 3-4+)

## üöÄ Quick Timeline

| **When** | **What** | **Customer Value** |
|---|---|---|
| Today | CLI with 378 tests | Find problems in dev |
| Week 2 | Runtime monitoring | See problems in prod |
| Week 4 | Web dashboard | Team visibility |
| Month 2 | Custom domains | Any industry |
| Month 6 | Platform standard | Industry trust |

## üí° Key Insights

### The 10% That Delivers 90% of Value
Developers don't need 100 features. They need confidence their AI works. We deliver this through:
- **Reliability scores** (know it works)
- **Cost tracking** (know what it costs)
- **Automatic fixes** (know how to improve)

### Why We Win
- **LangSmith**: Only LangChain ‚Üí We support everything
- **Braintrust**: Manual tests ‚Üí We auto-generate from failures  
- **Others**: Show problems ‚Üí We provide solutions

### The Magic Moment
A developer adds one line of code and suddenly sees their agent's reliability grade, cost per run, and how to fix issues. This "aha!" drives viral adoption.

## üìä Success Metrics

### Short Term (3 months)
- 10,000 developers using Arc-Eval
- 95% say it's "essential" to their workflow
- $1M ARR

### Long Term (24 months)
- Industry standard for AI reliability
- Every production agent uses Arc-Eval
- $100M ARR, IPO-ready

## üèÉ Next Steps

1. **This Week**: Start implementing runtime tracing
2. **Next Week**: Ship to first customers
3. **Month 1**: Iterate based on feedback
4. **Month 2**: Launch custom domains
5. **Month 3**: Raise Series A

## ü§ù How to Use These Docs

### For Engineering
- Start with phase docs (02, 03, 04) for implementation plans
- Use technical details for specific code examples

### For Product/Sales
- Use executive summary and solution overview
- Reference end state vision for long-term positioning

### For Investors
- Executive summary shows the opportunity
- Current state proves we can execute
- End state vision shows the potential
