# Arc-Eval Product Roadmap

This folder contains the complete product strategy for Arc's evolution from a CLI testing tool to a platform for AI reliability.

## ðŸ“š Document Guide

## Core Strategy

**We solve one burning problem exceptionally well:**
> "Will my AI agent work correctly in production?"

We answer this with three capabilities:
1. **Test** before deployment (current)
2. **Monitor** during runtime (weeks 1-2)
3. **Improve** continuously (weeks 3-4+)

## Quick Timeline

| **When** | **What** | **Customer Value** |
|---|---|---|
| Today | CLI with 378 tests | Find problems in dev |
| Week 1 | Runtime monitoring | See problems in prod |
| Week 2 | Web dashboard | Team visibility |
| Week 3 | Custom domains | Any industry |

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

### The 10% That Delivers 90% of Value
Developers don't need 100 features. They need confidence their AI works. We deliver this through:
- **Reliability scores** (know it works)
- **Cost tracking** (know what it costs)
- **Automatic fixes** (know how to improve)

### The "Magic" Moment
A developer adds one line of code and suddenly sees their agent's reliability grade, cost per run, and how to fix issues. This "aha!" drives viral adoption.
