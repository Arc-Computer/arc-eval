# Arc-Eval Product Strategy: Executive Summary

## The Opportunity

AI agents are becoming critical infrastructure for businesses, but developers lack tools to ensure reliability. Current solutions only show problems after they happen. Arc-Eval prevents problems before they occur.

## Our Vision: The 10% That Delivers 90% of Value

**The burning customer need**: "Will my agent work correctly in production?"

We solve this with three focused capabilities:
1. **Monitor** agents in real-time (Week 1-2)
2. **Learn** from failures automatically (Week 3-4)
3. **Expand** to any business domain (Month 2)

## Why We Win

| **Competitor** | **What They Do** | **What We Do Differently** |
|---|---|---|
| LangSmith | Shows errors in LangChain agents | Works with ANY framework + provides fixes |
| Braintrust | Manual test creation | Auto-generates tests from failures |
| Generic Tools | Surface-level metrics | Domain-specific compliance (SOX, HIPAA) |

## The Journey

### Today: Strong Foundation
- 378 pre-built tests for finance/security/ML
- 9+ framework support
- Proven evaluation engine

### Phase 1: Runtime Monitoring (Weeks 1-2)
- One-line integration
- Real-time reliability scores
- Cost optimization
- **Impact**: Developers know if agents work BEFORE customer complaints

### Phase 2: Self-Improvement (Weeks 3-4)
- Learn from production failures
- Auto-generate regression tests
- Provide code fixes
- **Impact**: Agents get more reliable over time, automatically

### Phase 3: Universal Coverage (Month 2)
- Custom domains (healthcare, retail, logistics)
- LLM-powered test generation
- Industry-specific compliance
- **Impact**: Any business can ensure AI reliability

## Customer Success Metrics

- **Before Arc-Eval**: 73% agent success rate, $0.019/run, 3 days to fix issues
- **After Arc-Eval**: 89% success rate, $0.007/run, fixes in minutes

## Go-to-Market Strategy

1. **Developer Adoption**: Free tier with 100 tests/month
2. **Team Expansion**: $99/month for unlimited tests
3. **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for compliance reports

## The Magic Moment

A developer adds one line of code. Suddenly they see:
- Their agent's reliability grade (B+)
- Exactly where it fails
- The code to fix it
- Proof it's getting better

This is the "aha!" that drives viral adoption.

## Call to Action

We have 2 weeks to ship runtime monitoring. This unlocks everything else. Let's build the tool every AI developer needs but doesn't know exists yet.
