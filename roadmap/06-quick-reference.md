## Core Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Local-First**: Data stays in customer environment
- **Framework-Agnostic**: Adapter pattern for any agent
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking evaluation pipeline
- **Plugin System**: Extensible evaluation framework

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite → PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Docker/Kubernetes

## Team Responsibilities

### Technical Founder
- Core architecture and vision
- Agent-as-a-Judge implementation
- Technical partnerships
- Open source strategy

### Founding Engineer
- Runtime monitoring (ArcTracer)
- Framework integrations
- Web dashboard
- Performance optimization

### GTM Lead
- Enterprise sales strategy
- Partnership development
- Customer success
- Market positioning

## Product Priorities

### Must Have (Core)
1. Runtime monitoring with < 50ms overhead
2. Framework auto-detection (9+ frameworks)
3. Web dashboard for team visibility
4. Predictive failure analysis

### Should Have (Differentiation)
1. Custom domain generation
2. Cross-framework learning
3. Compliance workflows
4. Cost optimization recommendations

### Nice to Have (Future)
1. Visual agent builder
2. Marketplace for optimizations
3. Multi-cloud deployment
4. Real-time collaboration

## Key Differentiators

1. **Find problems early**: Stop failures before production
2. **Works with any tool**: LangChain, OpenAI, CrewAI, custom
3. **Runs locally**: Keep data in your environment
4. **92% accurate**: Much better than 70% industry standard
5. **Gets smarter**: Learn from all users' agents

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Framework Changes**: Maintainable adapter architecture
- **Scale Challenges**: Horizontal scaling design
- **Performance Impact**: Strict latency budgets

### Business Risks
- **Slow Adoption**: Clear ROI messaging
- **Competition**: Focus on specialization
- **Pricing Pressure**: Value-based pricing model

## Success Criteria

### Q1 Goals
- Ship runtime monitoring
- 10 enterprise pilots
- 3 partner integrations
- $1M pipeline

### Q2 Goals
- Custom domains live
- 50 paying customers
- SOC2 compliance
- $2M ARR

### Q3 Goals
- Fleet management
- 200 customers
- Series A ready
- $5M ARR

## Quick Commands

### Development
```bash
# Run local tests
arc-eval compliance --domain finance --quick-start

# Test runtime monitoring
python -m agent_eval.trace.test_tracer

# Generate custom domain
arc-eval scenario create --domain healthcare
```

### Sales Demo
```bash
# Quick reliability check
arc-eval analyze --input customer_agent.json --quick

# Generate compliance report
arc-eval compliance --domain security --export pdf

# Show cost optimization
arc-eval optimize --input trace.json --show-savings
```

## Competitive Positioning

| Vs. | Key Message |
|-----|-------------|
| **Monitoring Tools** | "Prevent failures, don't just detect them" |
| **Dev Tools** | "Enterprise-ready from day one" |
| **Hyperscalers** | "Purpose-built for agents, not generic" |
| **Open Source** | "Zero-config with immediate value" |

## Customer Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have monitoring" | "Monitoring tells you about failures. We prevent them." |
| "Too expensive" | "One prevented production failure pays for a year." |
| "Another tool to manage" | "One-line integration, works with your existing stack." |
| "Not proven" | "92% accuracy, already preventing failures for X customers." |
