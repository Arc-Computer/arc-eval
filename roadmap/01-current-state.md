# Arc-Eval Today: Our Starting Point

## What We've Built

Arc-Eval is a production-ready CLI tool with deep evaluation capabilities:

### Core Strengths

| **Component** | **What It Does** | **Lines of Code** | **Maturity** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Domain Evaluation** | 378 scenarios across finance/security/ML | 15,000+ | Production-ready |
| **Framework Support** | Auto-detects 9+ agent frameworks | 580 | Proven |
| **Reliability Analysis** | Comprehensive scoring and grading | 2,900 | Battle-tested |
| **Fix Generation** | Framework-specific code remediation | 600 | Working |
| **Cost Tracking** | Token usage and optimization | 1,000 | Complete |
| **Compliance** | SOX, GDPR, HIPAA report generation | Built-in | Enterprise-ready |

### Current User Experience

```bash
# What developers can do today
arc-eval compliance --domain finance --input agent_outputs.json
arc-eval debug --input failed_trace.json --pattern-analysis
arc-eval improve --framework langchain --code-examples

# The limitation: requires static JSON files
# Developers must manually capture and analyze agent outputs
```

## The Gap We're Filling

### What's Missing
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Can't see agents as they run
2. **Automatic Learning**: Doesn't capture failures for future prevention
3. **Custom Domains**: Limited to finance/security/ML

### Why This Matters
- Developers find problems AFTER customers complain
- Each failure requires manual investigation
- Can't expand beyond our 3 built-in domains

## Our Assets

### Technical Foundation

├── evaluation/          # Judges and validators
├── analysis/           # Pattern learning, failure classification
├── domains/            # YAML-based evaluation packs
├── exporters/          # PDF, CSV, JSON reports
└── ui/                 # Rich terminal interface
```

### Proven Capabilities
- **ScenarioBank**: Generates tests from patterns
- **ReliabilityValidator**: 2,900 lines of analysis logic
- **RemediationEngine**: Framework-specific fixes
- **ComplianceReporter**: Audit-ready outputs

## The Opportunity

We have a Ferrari engine (evaluation) with a bicycle interface (static files). 

By adding:
1. Runtime capture (750 lines)
2. Web dashboard (500 lines)  
3. Custom scenarios (1,000 lines)

We transform from a diagnostic tool to a production monitoring platform.

## Resource Inventory

### What We Need
- 2 weeks of focused development
- API design for runtime integration
- LLM credits for scenario generation

### What We Have
- Complete evaluation infrastructure
- Working CLI with great UX
- Domain expertise in finance/security/ML
- Fix generation that actually works

## Next Step

Add runtime tracing to unlock our existing 15,000 lines of evaluation code for real-time use. This is the key that opens everything else.
